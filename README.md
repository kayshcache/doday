# Doday
Doday app Do today what you could do tomorrow list all desired tasks and daily routine items
features: 
- add routine/task
- mark done
- mark can not be done
- NO remove (part of the game) everything you add you have to do today or tomorrow or you lose
- losing game: state resets but todo list re-instantiates with option then to remove what CAN NOT be done.
- if not today it moves to tomorrow with priority
2 classes of todo objects: routines, tasks
both on a today or tomorrow schedule --- therefore click not today and it becomes tomorrows warning todo - if failure to do tomorrow GAME OVER.
Gamified with "doing streak" score + "done-a-lot" points board
Post-mvp ideas: flutter app / notifications / gnome extension
